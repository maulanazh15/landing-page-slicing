# Landing Page Inspired by Figma Design

This project is a fully responsive landing page created using Next.js, inspired by a design from Figma. The page layout consists of various sections, each styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, clean appearance. It utilizes components from `shadcn` for cards, buttons, and input fields, and `lucide-react` for icons. Here is the link to the figma design :
